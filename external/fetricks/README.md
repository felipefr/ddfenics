Useful tricks and extensions for Fenics and other FEM tools in Python

FE + tricks : where FE stands for Fenics, Finite Element, and the author of this (maybe) useful thing. 

This little projecy is born with the aim of assembling some tricks and extensions of Fenics (2019.1) and other FEM related stuff I have been using in different codes. They are mostly concerning applications in Continuum Mechanics, but not only that. There are also data management functions wrapping HDF5 python implementation.

One of the projects that use fetricks is micmacsfenics (https://github.com/felipefr/micmacsFenics), the only one which is public so far.

In some of them I took inspiration with the excellent tutorial of Jeremy Bleyer below:
